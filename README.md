## Navigating the Challenges

Building a product that prioritizes user experience and reliability is a continuous journey. We constantly strive to optimize GMonchain, ensuring a smooth and dependable platform for all our users.

User retention is another critical area we're actively addressing. To foster a vibrant and engaged community, we've rolled out exciting initiatives suchs as weekly reward events, generously supported by the Farcaster Rewards program.

Furthermore, GMonchain incorporates a unique daily token claim feature. While the daily rewards are modest, they serve as a powerful incentive, encouraging consistent interaction and building a daily habit around our miniapp.

### Innovative Staking Mechanism

Following the success of Airdrop Season 1, we've introduced an advanced staking mechanism designed to reward our dedicated community.

Users can stake their \$GM tokens in a dedicated pool. Weekly snapshots determine reward distribution for both stakers and holders. To ensure fairness and prevent manipulation, rewards are distributed randomly throughout the week.
